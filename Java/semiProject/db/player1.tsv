Arteta's three goals during the season all came from the penalty spot. In the FA Cup quarter-final against Everton he was made to re-take a spot kick but held his nerve to give Arsenal a crucial lead in the tie.
Mikel has been one of the Premier League¡¯s leading lights in his position for almost a decade, having represented Everton with distinction for six-and-a-half years before joining the Gunners in August 2011. He made 209 appearances for the Goodison Park side, scored 35 times and was named their Player of the Year on three occasions.

However, his stand-out performance came in the 1-1 draw against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena. Playing in central midfield, his ability to take on defenders, change the pace of the game and make incisive passes earned widespread praise and enhanced his reputation as a star in the making.
A groin injury kept Alex out of the final games of the season - including the FA Cup final - but he managed to prove his fitness in time to make England's 2014 World Cup squad.
Capable of altering the tempo of a game with a driving run or piece of skill, Alex joined the Gunners in August 2011 and burst on to the scene five months later with a man-of-the-match performance against Manchester United.
His fine first season saw him promoted to the England senior set-up and he played three times at Euro 2012. His excellent start to international life continued in 2013 when he scored a superb goal against Brazil at the Maracana Stadium.

The midfielder netted a further three goals after his return to take his tally to 16 for the season, which ended with a richly-deserved FA Cup winner¡¯s medal.
Aaron joined the Gunners from Cardiff City in the summer of 2008, aged just 17. He had already become the Bluebirds¡¯ youngest player (at 16 years 124 days), and was the fifth-youngest scorer in Champions League history when he netted for Arsenal against Fenerbahce in October of that year.
His progress received a setback when he sustained a serious leg fracture in February 2010, necessitating a long road to recovery that took in loans at Nottingham Forest and back at Cardiff. His rehabilitation was successful, and he is now a key player for club and country.

Mathieu first joined Arsenal in 2004 from Ligue 1 side Marseille and made 153 appearances for the Gunners before joining AC Milan in the summer of 2008. His stand-out season came in 2007/08, when he was a fixture in the midfield and delivered a string of all-action performances - catching the eye in a team that challenged for the Premier League title.
Mathieu won the Serie A title with Milan in 2010/11, playing an important role in the middle of the park. After his contract expired at the San Siro, he began training with Arsenal - signing for the club two weeks into the 2013/14 Premier League season.

"Abou"	"Diaby"	29	"France"	"Midfielder"	20	24	"Auxerre, Paris Saint-Germain"	"January 21, 2006"	"player_(4).jpg"	"Abou made his long-awaited return to the first team in the last Premier League game of the 2013/14 season away to Norwich City after more than 14 months out with a cruciate knee ligament injury. The midfielder spent much of his rehabilitation in his native France before returning to training in spring and making an appearance for the under-21 side in April."	"When fully fit, there are few Premier League midfielders who can match Abou for technique and presence on the ball. He demonstrated this with four fine performances early in the 2012/13 season, particularly during a 2-0 win at Liverpool.
He joined the Gunners from Auxerre at the age of 19 and, despite some serious injuries, has been integral to Arsene Wenger¡¯s plans when fit. The same can be said with the French national team, for whom he has won 16 caps and featured heavily in the 2010 World Cup campaign, playing all 270 minutes. He also won the Uefa Under-19 Championship in 2005 before injuries cruelly interrupted his career.
This season Abou will be hoping that, after completing his recovery, he is afforded the lengthy run of fitness that he deserves."	87	74	70	87	63	78
"Francis"	"Conquelin"	24	"France"	"Midfielder"	21	34	"Freiberg (loan), Lorient (loan)"	"September 23, 2008"	"player_(30).jpg"	"Young French midfielder Francis Coquelin featured for Arsenal across all competitions last season."	"A tigerish defensive midfielder with good acceleration and composure on the ball, his promising progress continued as he passed the 40-appearance mark for the Gunners. Starting all three Capital One Cup games, he also enjoyed a fine 90 minutes in the FA Cup win over Swansea and impressed in the Champions League group stage victory against Olympiacos. In addition he made three Premier League starts.
Francis also went on a one-month loan spell to Charlton Athletic at the start of the 2014/15 season and returned to Arsenal with valuable first-team experience, slotting straight back into Arsene Wenger's team.
Well known for his versatility, having also played in both full-back positions, Francis arrived from Laval in 2008 and was an FA Youth Cup winner in his first season as an Arsenal player. He debuted for the first team in the 6-0 Carling Cup win over Sheffield United in September 2008. He enjoyed a highly productive season on loan with French Ligue 1 side Lorient in 2010/11, with his achievements including a dramatic goal in the local derby against Rennes.
Francis has represented his country throughout the youth levels, and was a UEFA Under-19 Championship winner in 2010 ? starting four of France¡¯s five games. He also competed in the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in 2011.

"Gedion"	"Zelalem"	18	"Germany"	"Midfielder"	22	35	"Hertha Berlin"	" "	"player_(31).jpg"	"Exciting prospect Gedion became the first player to feature for Arsenal who was born after Arsene Wenger took charge when he made his debut in the FA Cup fourth-round game against Coventry City. The Germany youth international spent the majority of his season with the under-21s and played 22 times for the academy sides."	"Gedion arrived at the club in January 2013 after he was spotted by scout and former Gunner Danny Karbassiyoon playing in the Dallas Cup.
Formerly of Hertha Berlin, Gedion broke into the Gunners¡¯ under-21 team at the end of the 2012/13 season, turning in an assured performance on his debut against Liverpool at Anfield in April and winning many admirers with his ability on the ball and willingness to adapt to the physical side of English football.
Imaginative in possession and blessed with clever movement, the youngster added to that appearance with three more before the end of the campaign. During the summer of 2013 his progress continued when he was named in the first-team squad for the Asia Tour, and played in all four of the side¡¯s games in Indonesia, Vietnam and Japan.
Gedion particularly impressed with his vision - his assist for Theo Walcott¡¯s goal against Nagoya Grampus was especially memorable.
He also featured against Galatasaray in the Emirates Cup, and was subsequently named in the first-team squad for 2013/14, despite technically still being a first-year scholar in the academy.
